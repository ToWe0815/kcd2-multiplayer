# KCD2 Multiplayer

Experimental multiplayer mod for Kingdom Come: Deliverance II. Each player sees the other as a ghost NPC — position and rotation are synced in real time.

## Architecture

```
PC1: [KCD2 + Mod] ←localhost→ [KcdMpClient.exe] ──TCP──┐
                                                          ├── [KcdMpServer.exe]
PC2: [KCD2 + Mod] ←localhost→ [KcdMpClient.exe] ──TCP──┘
```

- **KcdMpServer.exe** — relay server, can run anywhere (one of the game PCs or a dedicated machine)
- **KcdMpClient.exe** — runs on every PC with the game; reads local position and pushes to the relay server, receives other players' positions and updates their ghost in the local game

Each client agent talks to its own game locally — no cross-LAN game API calls.

---

## Requirements

- Kingdom Come: Deliverance II
- KCD2 Modding Tools (free on Steam — separate library entry, needed to enable the debug API)

---

## Step 1: Install the Mod (both PCs)

1. Copy the `kdcmp` folder to your Modding Tools `Mods` directory:
   ```
   <ModdingTools>\Mods\kdcmp\
   ```
   Example: `D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\KCD2ModMods\Mods\kdcmp\`

2. Final folder structure:
   ```
   Mods/
     kdcmp/
       mod.manifest
       Data/
         kdcmp.pak
   ```

3. Always launch the game through **KCD2 Modding Tools** (not the base game shortcut).

4. Load a save, then verify the mod loaded — open `kcd.log` and look for:
   ```
   [KCD2-MP] === MOD INIT ===
   ```

---

## Step 2: Network Setup (both PCs)

The game's debug API listens only on `localhost:1403`. Open **PowerShell as Administrator** on **each PC** and run:

```powershell
# Expose the game API on port 1404 (accessible from the same machine)
netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenaddress=0.0.0.0 listenport=1404 connectaddress=127.0.0.1 connectport=1403
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="KCD2 API 1404" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=1404
```

Verify it works (game must have a save loaded):
```powershell
curl.exe http://localhost:1404/api/rpg/Calendar?depth=1
# Should return XML with GameTime > 0
```

### Open port 7778 on the relay server PC

On the PC that runs **KcdMpServer.exe**, also open the relay port:

```powershell
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="KCD2MP Relay 7778" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=7778
```

---

## Step 3: Run the Relay Server

Pick one PC (or a dedicated machine) to host the relay. Run:

```
KcdMpServer.exe
```

Or with a custom port:
```
KcdMpServer.exe --port 7778
```

You should see:
```
=== KCD2 Multiplayer Relay Server ===
Port: 7778

Listening on port 7778...
Waiting for clients to connect.
```

The server has no config — it doesn't need to know anyone's IP.

---

## Step 4: Run the Client Agent (every PC with the game)

Each player runs `KcdMpClient.exe` on their own machine.

```
KcdMpClient.exe <serverIP> <serverPort> <yourName> <gameApiUrl>
```

| Argument | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `serverIP` | IP of the PC running the relay server | `192.168.1.10` or `localhost` |
| `serverPort` | Relay server port (default 7778) | `7778` |
| `yourName` | Your display name | `PC1` |
| `gameApiUrl` | Local game debug API | `http://localhost:1404` |

### Example: relay server on PC1, two players

**PC1** (relay server + game on same machine):
```
KcdMpClient.exe localhost 7778 PC1 http://localhost:1404
```

**PC2**:
```
KcdMpClient.exe 192.168.1.10 7778 PC2 http://localhost:1404
```

Replace `192.168.1.10` with PC1's actual local IP (`ipconfig` → IPv4 Address).

When connected, you'll see:
```
Game ready!
Connected! Assigned id=1
[pos] 1042.3 847.1 204.6  rot=1.57
```

---

## Startup Order

1. Start **KcdMpServer.exe** (any time, stays running)
2. On each PC: launch the game via Modding Tools, load a save
3. On each PC: start **KcdMpClient.exe**
4. Both clients connect → players see each other's ghosts

Client agents automatically wait for the game to have a save loaded and reconnect if the relay server restarts.

## Building from Source

Requires [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).

```powershell
cd dotnet

# Run directly (development)
dotnet run --project KcdMp.Server
dotnet run --project KcdMp.Client -- localhost 7778 PC1 http://localhost:1404

# Build standalone .exe (no .NET required to run)
dotnet publish KcdMp.Server -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained -p:PublishSingleFile=true -o publish\server
dotnet publish KcdMp.Client -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained -p:PublishSingleFile=true -o publish\client
```

Output: `dotnet\publish\server\KcdMpServer.exe` and `dotnet\publish\client\KcdMpClient.exe`

---

## Troubleshooting

### `localhost:1404` not responding
- Make sure you launched the game through **Modding Tools**, not the base game
- Make sure a save is loaded (API returns nothing on the main menu)
- Run the portproxy command again (resets after Windows restart)

### Port 1403 not starting in the game
A URL reservation may be blocking it. Run as Admin:
```powershell
netsh http show urlacl | findstr 1403
# If found:
netsh http delete urlacl url=http://+:1403/
netsh http delete urlacl url=http://*:1403/
```
Then restart the game.

### Client can't connect to relay server
- Check relay server IP with `ipconfig` → IPv4 Address
- Make sure port 7778 firewall rule was added on the server PC
- Try `ping <serverIP>` from the client PC

### Mod not loading
Check `kcd.log` for `[KCD2-MP] === MOD INIT ===`. If missing:
- Verify the `kdcmp` folder is in the correct `Mods` directory
- Make sure the game was launched through Modding Tools

---

## Removing Network Setup

```powershell
netsh interface portproxy delete v4tov4 listenaddress=0.0.0.0 listenport=1404
netsh advfirewall firewall delete rule name="KCD2 API 1404"
netsh advfirewall firewall delete rule name="KCD2MP Relay 7778"
```

---

## Known Limitations

- Position and rotation sync only — no inventory, quests, or save sync
- Both players must have a save loaded for sync to work
- Ghost NPC appearance depends on NPC spawning in the area
